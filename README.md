# What is Arda?
Arda is an online, microservice-based and open source tool designed to manage team workloads. Arda provide a compact and very effective view about team's workloads for managers, 
helping them being better decision makers. For the team member, Arda is a simple way to report actives in a more general way.

# Description and history
Today is very important to measure the things. This need applies to all different areas in a company. In addition, receiving an optimized vision about resources allocation between 
different projects and individual workloads is critical for all (both the resources and their managers) because it allows the team to organize their routines, equalize work/life 
balance and being more effective in the deliverables.

Furthermore, how Technical Evangelists (TEâ€™s) that maintain the focus on cloud computing scenarios and frequently need to show different aspects of our cloud platform to our 
customers and partners in events and such, develop one web and mobile tool that uses completely our stack of technologies and it is delivered in the cloud could be very impactful 
to the team and to the community. This process could be very helpful for us in order to improve our technical skills.

The external community engagement with Microsoft is another aspect that a development of a tool like that can be helpful. If this project is open source (and we have intent to 
do this) we can work with external communities in order to request their collaboration with us during all the development process. Perhaps it could be a great entry port to us. 

**Arda** emerges like a good answer to this this questions. Our goal is highly concentered to use this process (development) and tool to address all this different needs, including 
some impact in our scorecard.
